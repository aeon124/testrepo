
The Matplotlib package is the most well-known library for data visualization, and it’s 
excellent for making graphs and plots. 
The graphs are also highly customizable. 
Another high-level visualization library, Seaborn, is based on matplotlib. 
Seaborn makes it easy to generate plots like heat maps, time series, and violin plots. 
For machine learning, the Scikit-learn library contains tools for statistical modeling, including regression, classification, clustering and others. 
It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, and it’s relatively simple to get started.
